# Futility

Futility is a library for the client or server that can help you detect naughty words in strings. Users can usually find a way around word blacklists and censorship is an almost impossilbe task, but if you have to do it, Futility can help. By providing a word list and an object that represents alternatives to letters in those words, Futility will buid a RegExp object that you can use to test your user's input.
